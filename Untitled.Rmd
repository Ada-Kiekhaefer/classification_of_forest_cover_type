## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
summary(cars)
```

```{r print_test_eval}
print(paste('test_eval = ', test_eval))
```

* Slope: Slope in degrees
* Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology: Horz Dist to nearest surface water in meters
* Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology: Vert Dist to nearest surface water in meters
* Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways: Horz Dist to nearest roadway in meters
* Hillshade_9am: Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice (0 to 255 index) 
* Hillshade_Noon: Hillshade index at noon, summer soltice (0 to 255 index)
* Hillshade_3pm: Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice (0 to 255 index)

### Categorical Features
* Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns):  0 (absence) or 1 (presence)  Wilderness area designation
* Soil_Type (40 binary columns): 0 (absence) or 1 (presence)
* Cover_Type (7 types): Forest Cover Type designation (1 to 7)              

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
